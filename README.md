# $g-2$ Shimming Notebooks

## Organization

Put your own notebooks in your own work directory.  Important common ones will go in the main directory.  We may try to get a jupyter hub running at some point, but this will do for now.

As a work flow standard, let's each have our own branch where we work on our notebooks.  Periodically merge them with the master though.

# Caveats

I added git-lfs for storing the files, since they are decent sized.  It seems slow, but that's fine.  You probably only need to commit stuff once a day or so.  You may need to install git-lfs on your machine though.
