# Shimming Paper Brainstorm

## Physics
- uniform field
- minimize field symmetries that couple to beam
- demonstrate bounds on radial field

## Design
- magnet construction
- adjustable shims
- shimming cart
- daq software

## Calibration
- metrolab
- laser
- capacitec
- tilt sensor
- radial field
- wedge shims
- pole feet
- top hats

## Measurements
- laser height (pole surface)
- pole tilts
- pole steps
- fluxgates
- ac transients
- long term drift
- shimstock calibration
- magnetic field

## Adjustments
- ring leveling
- pole feet
- top hats + wedges
- laminations

## Analysis
- impacts of <non-zero> fields on g-2
- contribution to errors from field
- fid frequency extraction
- field multipole analysis
- modeling shims
- optmizing field with shims
- modeling iron strips
- optimizing field with strips

## Puzzles
- 20 ppm normal quad
- large shift from removing dead correction coils
- discrepancy with nmr active volume
